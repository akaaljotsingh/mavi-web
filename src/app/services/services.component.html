            <li><span></span> <b>ARE RESPONSIVE </b>
              Speed is a considerable element. We try to reply to our clients as soon as possible and keep them in the loop and informed.</li>
            <li><span></span> <b>GIVE ATTENTION TO LISTENING </b>
              Avoid speaking but carefully listening to what they say. It's important to understand what a client expects from us, for
              the expectations to be fulfilled.</li>
            <li><span></span> <b>WHAT WE SAY WILL BE DONE</b>
              One of the biggest gripes in business today is what is said, that is simply not done till the full extent. But here it is
              what we say will surely be done and that even in proffesional manner.</li>
            <li><span></span> <b>KNOW YOUR STUFF</b>
              The client's perception is that, you are paid expert, that's why we have come to you to handle their mortgage. So be sure
              to keep your skills up to date, and be on the top of the game in your proffesion. Unfortunately, if you convey
              a lack of knowledge, then you risk ruining your credibility.</li>
            <!-- <li><span></span> <b>GIVE A LITTLE</b>
              If a client asks you to do something that really won't cost you a lot in time or money, then treat it as an oppourtunity
              to go the extra mile. By doing so, you not only have a contented and indebted client, but also someone who is
              more than happy to refer to you. </li> -->
